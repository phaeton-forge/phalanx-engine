# Unreleased (engine 0.3.0)

Entries collected per package until the synchronized 0.3.0 release
(Task 13 turns this file into `CHANGELOG.md`).

## @phalanx-engine/runtime

- New package `@phalanx-engine/runtime` (0.3.0, `private` until release):
  contracts and skeleton for server-side simulation, snapshots and
  reconnect (Task 1). Adds `defineGame`, `GameDefinition`, `MatchConfigBase`
  / `SlotConfig` / `simMode`, `CommandSchema`, the approved `GameState` /
  `GameStateSpec` / `StateWriter` / `StateReader` contract, the snapshot
  header and version policy types, `StateHelpers`, `BotPolicy`,
  `MatchRunner`, `CommandLog`, `WorldScope`, `Transport` and
  `LocalTransport`. Only `defineGame`, the constants and small helpers are
  implemented; everything else throws `NotImplementedError` naming the task
  that implements it.
- Design docs: `docs/design/server-sim.md`, `docs/design/reconnect.md`,
  `docs/design/runtime-api.md` (including the review of the contracts
  against the engine code).
- `AGENTS.md` §0 and §4.6 amended for opt-in server simulation and bot
  slots.
